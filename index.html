        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Kaushik Manikonda!</h1>
				<p>I am an interdisciplinary machine learning engineer with a background in Industrial engineering, Data Science, Statistics, Business Analytics, Astrophysics, and 
           Petroleum engineering. I am a joint doctoral student in the Harold Vance Department of petroleum engineering, and a master's student in the Wm Michael Barnes '64 
           Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. I received a bachelor’s degree in Astrophysics, and Mechanical engineering 
           from Arizona State University in 2017, before moving on to receive a master’s degree in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M University.
          
           I worked on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) HASP project between 2016-2017, before starting my master’s program at Texas A&M University. 
           My current research areas include, Machine learning applications for drilling automation, Leveraging data science techniques for early gas kick detection, and 
	   Big data analytics in the oil & gas industry.
           I am currently spending a few semesters abroad, at Texas A&M University - Qatar in Doha, Qatar as a visiting machine learning researcher. During my time at TAMUQ, 
           I will be leading the TAMUQ Flow Assurance Student Club as the president.</p>
